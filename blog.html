            <p> Six weeks into my journey to transition from professional composer to backened engineer, my emotions are mixed and varied. One conclusion emerges however...I really enjoy coding. <br><br>It is in some ways a startling realization. This decision,
                in it's inception, was more rooted in the need to move on from my previous life into one that had a future. What came as a shock was the constant delves into flow-state. Looking up after what felt like minutes considering a code block
                to find that I hadn't eaten in hours or that the sun had long since set. <br><br> It's tempting to lean into this feeling of immersion and obsession. To some degree it will be necessary for success. However, it is a slippery slope and
                one I intend to traverse carefully. <br><br> In the meantime, I will take this moment to enjoy the fact that I now understand how to make and use a binary search tree or that I know what duck-typing is, and I will channel that into steeling
                myself for how much frustration and progress are still on the horizon. I will remember that most important on this journey is to keep trying to be better than I was yesterday.</p>
